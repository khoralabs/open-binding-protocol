**OBP/1.0 — bilateral frame protocol (transport-agnostic).**

This namespace models the **Frame** DAG: causal integrity, signed actors, and **opaque** turn payloads. Graph vocabulary (**Party**, **Offer**, **Port**, edges) lives in **`khora.obp`**; **when** a bind is allowed and how policy JSON is validated lives in **`khora.obp.nbc`**.

**Layering:** Verify **`Frame`** signatures and **`p_hash`** chain first. Then (**NBC path**) validate opaque **`body`** against NBC rules and **`NbcPortExposePolicy`**. Finally project accepted effects to **`khora.obp#ObpPersistence`**. OBP-only stacks MAY skip NBC and use a documented private mapping from **`body`** to persistence ops.

**Relationship to persistence:** Accepted **TURN** effects **MUST** be projected to **`khora.obp#ObpPersistence`**
via **`OBPPersistenceClient`** (or equivalent) so graph invariants in `packages/obp/v2/persistence/spec/model/persistence.smithy` hold. **END_OFFERS** is a signed DAG step with **no** normative **`ObpPersistence`** projection in **`khora.obp`** — peers use it to record mutual visibility that an actor will not issue further offer-extending **TURN**s on this chain (bilateral coordination); optional local policy may still allow **TERMINATE** or stream teardown later. **TERMINATE** ends the frame session; it does
not alone mutate **`ObpPersistence`** unless implementations map it to optional revoke ops.

**Canonical JSON:** For any value **`v`**, implementations compute UTF-8 bytes of JSON with **recursively sorted object keys**;
arrays preserve order; **`null`**, booleans, numbers, and strings follow **`JSON.stringify`**. Call that **`canonical_json(v)`**.

**Signing input (`signing_bytes`):** Let **`signing_payload`** be the **`Frame`** object with the **`sig`** field omitted (or set to the
empty string). **`signing_bytes = UTF-8(canonical_json(signing_payload))`**. Implementations **MUST** verify **`sig`** over
 **`signing_bytes`** before accepting a frame.

**Post-frame state hash (tip):** After a frame is accepted, the local tip is **`tip = SHA-256( UTF-8(canonical_json(frame_complete)) )`**
where **`frame_complete`** is the full **Frame** including **`sig`**, with the same canonical JSON rules. The next frame's **`p_hash`**
**MUST** equal this **`tip`** (hex‑encoded **64** lowercase).

**Normative on‑wire framing (default):** Over any duplex byte stream, frames **MUST** be encoded as **`uint32_be(length)`** immediately
followed by **`length`** bytes of **`UTF-8(canonical_json(frameObject))`**, where **`frameObject`** is either an **`init`** envelope
(see below) or a **Frame**. Alternative bindings **MAY** substitute an equivalent framing that preserves strict ordering and message
boundaries; see **`khora.obp.frame.http2`**.

**Session bootstrap:** Framed objects **MAY** include multiple **`{ "init": `<SessionInit JSON>` }`** envelopes on the **same** duplex byte stream (long‑lived multiplex): each distinct **`session_id`** / **`genesis_hash`** pair starts a separate causal chain. Implementations **MUST** route each **Frame** to the unique open chain whose current tip or registered **`genesis_hash`** equals **`p_hash`**. Keys SHOULD be sorted for canonical framing. Between **`init`** messages, **hub-mediated** deployments that adopt the **frame relay policy** **MUST** frame payloads as **`khora.obp.frame.relay#RelayEnvelope`** (`frame` + `relay_ts_ms`); that policy is **not** part of core **`khora.obp.frame`** — see `packages/obp/frame-relay/spec/model/hub-protocol.smithy`. Direct streams **without** a relay **MAY** send bare **`Frame`** objects.

**Relay echo (when relay policy applies):** Originators MUST apply **`Frame`** effects only from **`khora.obp.frame.relay#RelayEnvelope`** bytes received back from the relay (including self-echo), not from the pre-relay send path, so **`relay_ts_ms`** and DAG advance stay consistent with the counterparty.

**Turn contract (informal):** After **init**, any actor may send a **TURN** frame. Semantics of **`body`** (extend offer, expose ports, bind) are **not** defined here — see **`khora.obp.nbc`** and **`khora.obp#ObpPersistence`**. Causal order is enforced only by **`p_hash`**: each frame's **`p_hash`** MUST equal the local DAG tip (**`CAUSAL_MISMATCH`** otherwise). The wire protocol does **not** imply strict alternation between parties — that is **transport-scoped**. Purely decentralized transports **MAY** embed alternation hints inside the opaque **`body`**.

**END_OFFERS:** Either party **MAY** send **`END_OFFERS`** instead of **TURN** on their move to advance the tip while signaling they will send **no further offers** (no further offer-extending **TURN**s) to the counterparty on this chain. Verifiers apply the same **`p_hash`** and signature rules as **TURN**. **`body`** is opaque; empty object is permitted.

**TERMINATE** may be sent when allowed by local policy; **`body`** remains opaque at this layer.

**Frame-channel body confidentiality:** In **hub-mediated WebSocket frame channels**, implementations **SHOULD** encrypt logical **TURN**, non-handshake **END_OFFERS**, and **TERMINATE** **`body`** values using a documented **`e2ee`** JSON wrapper (`v`, `alg`, `iv`, `ct`) over canonical JSON plaintext, after an **`e2ee_hs`** handshake carried as plaintext on two **`END_OFFERS`** frames. **Ed25519 signatures** are computed over the **ciphertext** **`body`**. **`init`** envelopes and DAG fields (`type`, `p_hash`, `actor`, `sig`) remain visible to the relay. Host-held room ticket / pairing secrets **MUST NOT** be the sole input to these message keys. Normative notes: `packages/obp/v2/frames/impl/ts/docs/FRAME_CHANNEL_E2EE.md`.

**Hardened constraints (draft §8):**
1. **Strict ordering:** reject when **`p_hash`** ≠ local tip.
2. **Identity verification:** reject invalid **`sig`**; session **SHOULD** abort.
3. **NBC bind-window / capacity:** after NBC (if any) admits a bind, the **`ObpPersistence`** NBC projection (**`nbc_expires_*`** columns / **`getNbcBindWindowFor*`** reads — not fields on thin **`khora.obp#Offer`** / **`khora.obp#Port`**) evaluated against **`turn_seq`** and **`relay_ts_ms`** from **`khora.obp.frame.relay#RelayEnvelope`** when hub relay policy is in use on the binding **TURN**, plus **`NbcPortExposePolicy.max_bindings`** (see **`khora.obp.nbc`**), constrain the store.
4. **No partial binds:** NBC and persistence layers **MUST** reject partial bind projections; opaque **`body`** must not commit a half-applied **BINDS** edge.

**Mapping to decentralized session sync:** Each accepted frame yields one or more replayable **`khora.obp.session#SessionOp`** values
for **`NegotiationSessionProtocol`** checkpoints; **`SessionOp.payload`** carries opaque replay material aligned with this **`body`** contract (**`kind`** **`turn`**, **`end_offers`**, **`terminate`**, …).

**Concurrent transport sessions:** Servers **MAY** accept **many** open streams at once (one negotiated stream per client session). **How** each logical bilateral session is backed—dedicated **`ObpPersistence`**, a shared store with partitioning, or otherwise—is **implementation-defined**; this protocol **MUST NOT** be read as requiring per-session physical isolation. Projections **MUST** satisfy **`khora.obp#ObpPersistence`** invariants in `packages/obp/v2/persistence/spec/model/persistence.smithy` on whatever store they use, including NBC **global canonical `NbcPortExposePolicy.max_bindings`** and **atomic** enforcement when concurrent operations mutate the **same** logical graph (see invariant **11** in `packages/obp/v2/persistence/spec/model/persistence.smithy` for shared vs separate store boundaries).

**Explicit non-goals here:** hostnames, ports, TLS, and URLs — see transport bindings (e.g. **`khora.obp.frame.http2`**).
