# Security policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release on the default branch. Older major/minor lines may not receive backports unless noted in release notes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

1. Use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/khoralabs/obp/security/advisories/new) for this repository, if enabled, **or**
2. Contact the maintainers through your organization's usual secure channel if you are an internal contributor.

Include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce or a minimal proof of concept
- Affected package versions and commit SHA if known

We aim to acknowledge reports within a few business days and will coordinate disclosure timing with you.

## Scope notes

This repository provides OBP protocol specifications and reference TypeScript implementations (graph persistence, NBC, frames, session, transports). It does **not** provide end-user authentication, production key management, or encrypted storage guarantees by itself. Hosts remain responsible for protecting persistence backends, relay admission secrets, transport credentials, and any product-specific policy enforcement.
